    "# Web Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the data you process or resources you will use in data analysis will not initially\n",
    "be on a local device. To access remote data and resources you will need to know how data\n",
    "is transferred and processed through the web, now called the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foundational Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### [**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of methods (verbs) and data structures (nouns) exposed by a server, program, or\n",
    "process for use by a client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [**Re**presentation **S**tate **T**ransfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)\n",
    "\n",
    "A convention for how a server structures and exposes an **API**. This is the dominate\n",
    "convention used to for web data processing. It is characterized by the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All resources on the server have a unique address, such as an\n",
    "[**U**niform **R**esource **L**ocator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL).\n",
    "* Each resource will point to dependent resources so that a client can explore and use\n",
    "the resources without additional information. This is usually done through relative paths.\n",
    "Note this is the most commonly violated property, hence the proliferation of API docs.\n",
    "* The server and client both maintain a *state* independent of each other, and are blind\n",
    "to the internals of each others *state*.\n",
    "* The history is independently *persisted* on each side through their internal states.\n",
    "* The client interactions with the server are *stateless*. There is no shared *session*. The\n",
    "server does not need to know the details of the client to process the *request*. Likewise\n",
    "the client does not need to know the details of the server to process the *response*.\n",
    "* Clients initiate *transactions* on the server by sending a *request* to the server\n",
    "that invokes one single method (verb) exposed by the server. The request contains the\n",
    "description of the *transition* (nouns), changes, that have occurred on the client side.\n",
    "This can include *\"I need data.\"*. In strict **ReST** verbs are not included in the body of\n",
    "the request.\n",
    "* The server is responsible for taking the *transition transactions* and updating its own\n",
    "internal state. This can include *\"No change necessary.\"*\n",
    "* The server sends the client a *response* used to *transition* the client state. This can\n",
    "include *\"Here is the data you asked for.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "The gist is that the server exposes a limited set of methods (verbs) that can be applied\n",
    "to a large number of locations (object nouns). The client invokes a method (verb) on a \n",
    "location (object noun) optionally supplying data (subject nouns).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Manager (client) says \"Body shop technician (server) please paint (verb) car `X47T`\n",
    "> (object noun) with this green paint (subject noun).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### [**H**yper **T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP)\n",
    "The main convention for processing information on the web. In principle it conforms to\n",
    "**ReST**, in practice there are wide variations. There are a number of important **API**\n",
    "methods for working with web server data, each of these methods must be called against a\n",
    "**URL**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `HEAD` is there a resource at that location and if so send the metadata *headers*.\n",
    "* `OPTIONS` of the below methods, which ones does does the location support.\n",
    "* `GET` return the data at the location.\n",
    "* `POST` using only the attached data create a new resource, server will return the location\n",
    "of the created resource.\n",
    "* `PUT` using only the attached data replace an existing resource, data not included will be\n",
    "dropped.\n",
    "* `PATCH` using the attached data update an existing resource, keeping any data not included\n",
    "in the request.\n",
    "* `DELETE` remove the location.\n",
    "There are more methods, however these are the main ones for working with web server\n",
    "**API**s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields)\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with **HTTP** every *request* and *response* is prefixed by a *header* which\n",
    "contains metadata about the message. A few important headers that are edited frequently:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Client Request Fields\n",
    "    * `Authorization` this contains security information. The accepted standard is for the\n",
    "    client to send a cryptographically secure pseudo-random **API** key that the server\n",
    "    previously generated and distributed through a secondary channel. The key is sent as a \n",
    "    *bearer token credential*. The format is `Authorization: Bearer <<API key>>`.\n",
    "    * `Accept` the content type the client will be accept in the response.\n",
    "    * `Content-Type` the type of media contained in the clients request. The main types for\n",
    "    data processing:\n",
    "        * `Content-Type: application/json` for data transactions\n",
    "        * `Content-Type: text/html` for webpages this is usually\n",
    "        * `Content-Type: text/csv` for CSV \n",
    "        * `Content-Type: text/plain` for plain text, including MarkDown\n",
    "        * `Content-Type: application/xml` for XML.\n",
    "    * `Content-Length` the length of the body of the request in bytes.\n",
    "* Server Response Fields\n",
    "    * `Content-Type` same as above.\n",
    "    * `Content-Length` same as above.\n",
    "    * `Location` the new location of a requested resource, for a 300 redirection response.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that if secure **HTTPS** is used, then the headers are encrypted as well. Never transmit\n",
    "headers containing *credentials* on insecure **HTTP**. As well, the use of *basic*\n",
    "authorization is discouraged as the username and password credentials are sent as encoded\n",
    "plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of common violations of **ReST** in many **HTTP** **API** services:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using a `GET` to explicitly create or update on the server, through URL key-value\n",
    "parameters. In strict **ReST** URL parameters are meant to refine the request such as\n",
    "specifying search strings.\n",
    "* Using a `POST` for general transactions. In this case one might see JSON fields called\n",
    "`action` and `id` that specify how the resources should be modified. In strict **ReST**,\n",
    "servers should implement `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` for modifying actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard Python library for communicating with web servers is [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html). For the most part the library transparently handles securing\n",
