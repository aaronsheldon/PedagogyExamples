    "and game theory. The Monty Hall Problem is a game of chance with conditional information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The game begins with a prize randomly hidden behind one of three doors.\n",
    "2. The reader chooses an initial door out of the three.\n",
    "3. A door that neither the reader has chosen, nor containing a prize is then opened.\n",
    "4. The reader can then optionally choose to switch their choice of doors to the remaining\n",
    "unopened door.\n",
    "5. Finally the prize door is revealed. If it is the final choice of the reader then the\n",
    "reader wins, otherwise the reader loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The counterintuitive result of this game is that the optimum strategy is for the reader to\n",
    "always switch their choice of doors, as that has a two thirds chance of winning. In this\n",
    "notebook the reader acts as the contest and can play multiple rounds of the game. When the\n",
    "reader stops playing the wins and loses are cross-tabulated by the strategy the reader\n",
    "chose."
